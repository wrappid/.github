# `Wrappid`

## Wrapper Framework for Rapid development

`Wrappid` Framework is a wrapper framework built to enable rapid development of applications based on `React` and `React Native`. You **write code once**, and use `Wrappid toolkit` to build your web and mobile applications simultaneously.

`Wrappid` includes a repository of components, called the `CoreComponents`, for application developers to use. The application developers also have the flexibility to write their own components. By default the styling libraries used are `mui` for web and `react native paper` for mobile.

`Wrappid` also comes with a set of pre-coded business handling modules like app builder, user/role/permission management, authentication, authorization, error reporting, notifications (push/mail/sms/whatsapp), etc.
