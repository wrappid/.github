## Our Responsibilities

The Wrappid team is responsible for maintaining these standards and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behaviour. This includes removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. The team reserves the right to ban any contributor whose behaviour they consider harmful, threatening, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate.
## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, both online and in-person, and applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting on official Wrappid social media accounts, or acting as a designated representative at online or offline events.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Wrappid team at wrappid.framework@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed appropriate to the situation. The Wrappid team is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the person reporting the incident. Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from community channels, or other actions as deemed appropriate by the team.
## Appeal Process
If a contributor is banned, they may contest the decision by emailing wrappid.framework@gmail.com with the subject line "Appeal Ban for [Your Name]" and providing the following information:
Why do you believe the Code of Conduct was not violated.
